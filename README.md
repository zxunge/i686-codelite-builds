# i686-codelite-builds
Automatic builds of i686 architected CodeLite.

## Some Notes About the Releases
Those binaries are built using GitHub Action (GHA) and MSYS2 clang32 port.
The build-deps directory contains the wxWidgets and wx-config program used in building. So you can build other CodeLite Plugins using them.
